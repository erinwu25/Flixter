# Project 2 - Flixster

Flixster shows the latest movies currently playing in theaters. The app utilizes the Movie Database API to display images and basic information about these movies to the user.

Time spent: 22-ish hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **scroll through current movies** from the Movie Database API
* [x] Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
* [x] For each movie displayed, user can see the following details:
  * [x] Title, Poster Image, Overview (Portrait mode)
  * [x] Title, Backdrop Image, Overview (Landscape mode)
* [x] Allow user to view details of the movie including ratings and popularity within a separate activity

The following **stretch** features are implemented:

* [x] Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
* [x] Apply rounded corners for the poster or background images using [Glide transformations](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#transformations)
* [ ] Apply the popular [View Binding annotation library](http://guides.codepath.org/android/Reducing-View-Boilerplate-with-ViewBinding) to reduce boilerplate code.
* [/] Allow video trailers to be played in full-screen using the YouTubePlayerView from the details screen. (slash instead of check because it doesn't automatically fullscreen)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

I learned a lot while creating this app, and struggled with figuring out what everything does. I had a big knowledge chasm to cross to get the app to where it is, but I feel like I did an adequate job. One challenge I faced was difficulty in figuring out where to put certain API calls so that one would load in time to send information to another. After some experimenting, I found a place that didn't make everything crash, so I went with it.
